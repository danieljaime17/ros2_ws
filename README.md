üõ†Ô∏è Project Description

This ROS 2-based project captures live video from a USB camera, publishes it as a ROS topic, and uses a second node to perform real-time object detection using a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model. Detected objects are annotated with bounding boxes and confidence scores. Both the raw and annotated video streams can be visualized using RViz2 or rqt_image_view. This setup provides a modular foundation for autonomous perception systems, ideal for integration in mobile robots or autonomous vehicles.
